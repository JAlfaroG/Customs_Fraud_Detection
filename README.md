# Customs Fraud Detection under BACUDA(바꾸다) project

## BACUDA (BAnd of CUstoms Data Analysts)
BACUDA (BAnd of CUstoms Data Analysts) is a collaborative research project of the World Customs Organization (WCO), Members and data scientists. It aims to develop data analytics algorithms in open-source languages so that all the Members can deploy them with their own data.

## DATE (Dual Attentive Tree-aware Embedding for Customs Fraud Detection)
The DATE model is the first outcome of BACUDA project, which is a risk management (targeting) tool to detect under-valued imports while maximizing Customs revenue. Our paper will be published in the Proceedings of the 26th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (2020).

## This repository: Step-by-Step toward DATE
This repository is dedicated to providing stepping stones toward DATE model for Customs administrations and officials, who want to develop their capacities to use machine learning in their daily works. 
This repository will provide prerequisite knowledge and practices for DATE model, so that beginners could better understand cutting edge algorithms such as ATTETION in the model.
