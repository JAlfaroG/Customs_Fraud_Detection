# Machine Learning for Customs Fraud Detection 

## BACUDA (바꾸다, BAnd of CUstoms Data Analysts)
BACUDA (BAnd of CUstoms Data Analysts) is a collaborative research project of the World Customs Organization (WCO), Members and data scientists. It aims to develop data analytics algorithms in open-source languages so that all the Members can deploy them with their own data.

## DATE (Dual Attentive Tree-aware Embedding for Customs Fraud Detection)
The DATE model is the first outcome of BACUDA project, which is to detect under-valued imports while maximizing Customs revenue. Our research paper will be published in the Proceedings of the 26th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (2020).

## This repository: stepping stones toward DATE
This repository is dedicated to providing stepping stones toward DATE model for Customs administrations and officials, who want to develop their capacities to use machine learning in their daily works. 
This repository will provide prerequisite knowledge and practices for machine learning, so that Customs community could better understand cutting edge algorithms in DATE model.
